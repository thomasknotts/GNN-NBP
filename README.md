This repository contains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to predict the normal boiling point of organic compounds based on their SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation. This project bridges cheminformatics and machine learning to accurately estimate a fundamental physical property critical in chemical engineering and material science.

The model takes molecular SMILES strings as input, transforms them into molecular graphs, and applies GNN techniques to predict boiling points.
