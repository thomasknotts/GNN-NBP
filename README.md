This repository contains two Graph Neural Network (GNN) models designed to predict the normal boiling point of organic compounds based on their SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation. This project bridges cheminformatics and machine learning to accurately estimate a fundamental physical property critical in chemical engineering and material science.

The model takes molecular SMILES strings as input, transforms them into molecular graphs. The user selects either GCN or MPNN from the dropdown, and after clicking "Predict" obtains the predicted normal boiling point in units of K from the selected model.
